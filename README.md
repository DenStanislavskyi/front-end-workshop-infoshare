A simple HTML5 + CSS landing page

## Setup

Once you have cloned the forked repository, go into the directory containing the project and look for the `/src` directory. This is the directory where you will be making changes when you start following the step-by-step instructions. You can simply open those files in a text editor and get started.

Once you have Node installed, open your command line and follow these instructions:

```
cd HTMLPortfolioProject
npm install
npm start
```

Running `npm start` should open a browser window pointing to `http://localhost:3000`. Now once you make changes to the files under the `/src` directory, your browser will refresh automatically, displaying the newest changes made to the files. This will save you the round trip of saving files and clicking refresh on your browser.
